NAME
====

**pond** â€” a shell environment manager for the fish shell

SYNOPSIS
========

| **pond** [*options*]
| **pond** *command* \[*options*] ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

A pond represents a collection of shell variables (and in a future release functions) within the fish shell. Ponds are used to group related shell variables together. Naming ponds after individual applications or local development environments is a good way to separate and control them by use-case.

Pond provides tab completion for all commands and options discussed here in addition to pond name completion for any ponds that exist.

Options
-------

**-h,** **\--help**

:   Print brief usage information

**-v,** **\--version**

:   Print the current version string

COMMANDS
========

**create** [**-e**|**\--empty**] [**-p**|**\--private**] _pond_
---------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new pond named _pond_. Each pond comprises a directory tree containing a single file for storing shell variable definitions (i.e. **set**(1) commands) and a _functions_ subdirectory intended for storing *autoloaded* fish functions (to be implemented in a future update).

A pond may be marked **\--private** during creation. Private ponds are intended to store shell variables that contain sensitive values (e.g. tokens or keys). Private ponds are stored in a separate directory tree to regular ponds and their collective parent directory is given 0700 permissions rather than the 0755 permissions used by regular ponds. In addition, private ponds may be treated differently by pond commands introduced in future updates.

By default, a directory named _pond_ is created within either the **regular** or **private** subdirectory under **\$\_\_fish\_config\_dir/pond/** dependent upon the type of the pond.


**-e**, **\--empty**

:   Create an empty pond without opening an interactive editor

**-p**, **\--private**

:   Create a private pond

**remove** [**-s**|**\--silent**] _pond_
---------------------------------------

Remove the pond named _pond_. The directory containing pond data will be erased (typically a subdirectory of the name _pond_ located in **\$\_\_fish\_config\_dir/pond/regular/** or **\$\_\_fish\_config\_dir/pond/private/**. Confirmation from the user is expected, with a **yes** response to confirm removal, but can be silenced (automatically accepted) using **\--silent**.

**-s**, **\--silent**

:   Silence confirmation prompt (automatically accept)

**list**
--------

List all ponds.

**edit** _pond_
---------------

Open an interactive editor for modifying shell variables in a pond (i.e. **set**(1) commands).

**enable** _pond_
-----------------

Enable pond _pond_ if not already enabled. A symbolic link will be created in **\$\_\_fish\_config\_dir/pond/links** to the pond directory (the pond directory path can be viewed using the **status** command). When new shell sessions are created any such symbolic links are followed and the **env\_vars.fish** file in each enabled pond directory is sourced into the envrionment to make its shell variables available to processes.

**disable** _pond_
------------------

Disable pond _pond_ if not already disabled. The symbolic link to the pond directory in **\$\_\_fish\_config\_dir/pond/links** is removed. Any shell variables that exist in _pond_ will no longer be accessible to processes when new shell sessions are created after disabling the pond.

**load** _pond_
---------------

Load pond _pond_.

**unload** _pond_
-----------------

Unload pond _pond_.

**-v**, **\--verbose**

:   Output variable names during unload

**status** _pond_
-----------------

View status of _pond_. Status information includes the _name_ of the pond, its _enabled_ state (**yes** or **no**), _private_ state (**yes** or **no**) and the absolute _path_ to the directory comprising its data.

**drain** [**-s**|**\--silent**] _pond_
---------------------------------------

Drain all shell variables from _pond_. Draining a pond effectively removes all content from the pond's **env\_vars.fish** file. If the pond was previously enabled (prior to the current shell session being created) or loaded into the current shell session with the **load** command, its variables will remain set and accessible to processes spawned by the current shell.

**-s**, **\--silent**

:   Silence confirmation prompt (automatically accept)

ENVIRONMENT
===========

A number of _universal_ shell variables (see **set**(1) for discussion of _universal_ variables) are set during installation. These variables control different aspects of functionality of **pond** and may be modified by changing their values as described here:

**pond\_editor**

:   The editor to open when using the **create** or **edit** commands. May be set to an absolute path or the name of a command accessible via one of the paths specified in the **PATH** environment variable. During installation this variable is set to the value of the **EDITOR** environment variable, if set, or one of **vim**, **vi**, **emacs**, or **nano**, whichever is found first in one of the paths set in **PATH**, working from left to right. An error may be generated during installation if no suitable editor is found.

**pond\_enable\_on\_create**

:   The value of this shell variable is set to **yes** by default and will cause all ponds created with the **create** command to be enabled by default. To disable this behaviour set the value of this varible to **no**.

    _Default:_ **yes**.
